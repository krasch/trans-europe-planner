## How to start this locally

### When you don't have npm / are not usually a Javascript developer

Node/npm are not necessary to run this project. If you are on linux, you can simply
run the following commands from the root folder of the project to start a local server:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

Then head to http://localhost:8000/.

If you are on windows and/or don't have python, please install python or use a different
server (e.g. npm, see below).

### When you do have npm 

From the root folder of the project, run the following commands to install the 
development dependencies and start the webserver

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then head to http://localhost:8000/.

## How to start developing

```
# install development dependencies
npm install

# run tests
npm test

# apply code formatting
npm run make-pretty
```

## Is this a react/vue.js/etc app?

No, just plain old vanilla Javascript, not even using a bundler or anything like that. Serving
up HTML+JS+CSS just like we did in the 90s. But, of course, keeping up-to-date with the features
of each of those three.
